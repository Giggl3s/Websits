            <h2>Virtues and Vices</h2>
            <p>John Proctor never gives up on his wife when she goes to court for supposed witchcraft. He goes to the court with Mary Warren so she could tell the judges that the poppet they found was hers, and it was an accident and it wasn't Elizabeth'
                poppet sitting around the house.</p>
            <h2>Original Text</h2>
            <p>John Proctor cares about his family and Mary Warren and doesnt want them to get hung. Elizabeth Proctor went to court to get tried for witchcraft but John Prcotor was there with evidence to try to stop her from getting hung, but she was pregnant
                and wasn't going to get hung because she was pregnant. He tells her that he is going to confess but when he confesses he rips up his paper with his confession with it and he gets hung.</p>
